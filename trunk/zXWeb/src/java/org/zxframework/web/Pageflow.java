/**
 * The famous zX pageflow object. 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * Associated with this object are all the clsPF* objects.
 * This object is supposed to be created by the HTML object as factory, i.e.
 * 
 *  set objPageflow = objHTML.getPageflow
 * 
 * NOTE: For this to really work, we need the PageFlow object and the XML/HTML outputter to be independent 
 * from the Servlet stuff.
 * 
 * 
 * Change    : BD11DEC02
 * Why       : Different class for submit buttons
 * 
 * Change    : DGS17JAN2003
 * Why       : QueryDef generates Where clauses with the preceding AND,
 *             whereas normal pageflow usually doesn't. Therefore, to avoid confusion
 *             when trying to use the same query in and out of pageflows, handle the
 *             situation by not adding another AND when one exists at the start.
 *             Order By clause is similar.
 * 
 * Change    : DGS14FEB2003
 * Why       : processRef will now generate a clickable image instead of a ref or submit button
 *             if the PF descriptor includes the image URL.
 * 
 * Change    : BD19FEB03
 * Why       : - Process any HTML related tags associated with the action
 *             - Added BO function handler to expression
 * 
 * Change    : BD20FEB03
 * Why       : - Implement active director
 * 
 * Change    : DGS28FEB2003
 * Why       : Implement popups
 * 
 * Change    : BD23MAR02
 * Why       : Added #havelock director
 * 
 * Change    : BD27MAR03
 * Why       : - Better default label for submit buttons
 *             - Added the ingroup director
 * 
 * Change    : BD28MAR03
 * Why       : Made resolveDirector bit smarter so that we can leave
 *             entity out if there is only one entity in the collection
 * 
 * Change    : BD31MAR03
 * Why       : Added directors #viewonlygroup and #notviewonly to make the
 *             handling of locking a bit easier
 * 
 * Change    : BD1APR03
 * Why       : Make sure the expression BO context is empty when we start
 * 
 * Change    : BD8APR03
 * Why       : Allow directors in Javascript tag
 * 
 * Change    : BD8APR03
 * Why       : Revised the processRef function
 * 
 * Change    : BD8APR03
 * Why       : Added #null / #notnull functions
 * 
 * Change    : BD9APR03
 * Why       : Fixed bug in processPKWhereGroup; taking wrong offset
 *             when we have 2-character length operators (e.g. <= or >= or %%)
 * 
 * Change    : DGS14APR2003
 * Why       : Implement Entity Massagers
 * 
 * Change    : BD16APR03
 * Why       : Added #inqs and #notinqs director added
 * 
 * Change    : DGS16APR2003
 * Why       : Further tweak to Entity Massagers to allow wider use
 * 
 * Change    : BD28APR03
 * Why       : Added facility to allow incoming querystring to be copied to
 *             outgoing 'as-is'. This will make the pageflows a lot easier to maintain
 * 
 * Change    : BD12MAY03
 * Why       : - Moved director support to zX level
 *             - Added support for multiple submit buttons
 * 
 * Change    : BD15MAY03
 * Why       : - Fixed bug with not treating frameno 0 and notouch the same....
 *             - Added parent / grandparent frameno
 * 
 * Change    : BD22MAY03
 * Why       : - Fixed bug in resolveEntity: group to load can be a director
 * 
 * Change    : BD5JUN03
 * Why       : Fixed bug in processAttributeValues where boolean value
 *             was always set to true!
 * 
 * Change    : DGS23JUN2003
 * Why       : ProcessMessages now also processes narrative, if any.
 *             New function 'getLabel', similar to existing 'resolveLabel' (and which now calls
 *             getLabel) but doesn't resolve directors in the retrieved label. Used when narrative
 *             has checkbox 'is a director' not set.
 * 
 * Change    : BD23JUN03
 * Why       : Made re-usable handle window footer and title method
 * 
 * Change    : DGS27JUN2003
 * Why       : Change to getEntityCollection for Edit sub actions. Now expects a string as the
 *             final parameter rather than a sub action enum. The string can contain various
 *             combinations of pre and post edit form sub actions.
 * 
 * Change    : DGS15JUL2003
 * Why       : Suppress Copy buttons when New persist status (like Create button is suppressed)
 * 
 * Change    : BD12AUG03
 * Why       : Save / restore quick context when generating URL's. This is essential
 *             as otherwise the query string entries that are used in an URL are permanently
 *             stored into the quick context and thus find there way to all subsequent
 *             URL's if propagate QS is switched on
 * 
 * Change    : BD15AUG03
 * Why       : Added tag support for treeColumn1, 2 and 3
 * 
 * Change    : BD27AUG03
 * Why       : Added ability to refer to external actions
 * 
 * Change    : BD4SEP03
 * Why       : Added advanced support for where groups
 * 
 * Change    : DGS19SEP2003
 * Why       : New Grid editform/createupdate actions: uses a QS entry -pgmore, and behaves
 *             similar to normal editform/createupdate in some case statements
 * 
 * Change    : DGS26SEP2003
 * Why       : Added support for swapping to/from Alternative Connections. This allows
 *             an application to access more than one database.
 * 
 * Change    : BD23OCT03
 * Why       : Change input type to submit for ref submit buttons that have
 *             an URL associated with it as submit buttons are default
 * 
 * Change    : BD31OCT03
 * Why       : Add parameter to zXSubmitThisUrl to distinguish between
 *             submit button and non-submit button
 * 
 * Change    : DGS24NOV03
 * Why       : when processing attribute values, switch validate off as
 *             it may be that because of the context the system is trying to
 *             set attributes to invalid values and yet this is correct
 * 
 * Change    : BD26NOV03
 * Why       : - Allow action in go method to be reference to external
 *               pageflow
 *             - When debugging is on, use liveDump to trace expressions
 * 
 * Change    : BD20NOV03
 * Why       : No longer clear the BOContext in getEntityCollection
 *             NOTE THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPOTRANT CHANGE WITH POTENTIAL
 *             CONSEQUENCES FOR OLDER PAGEFLOWS
 * 
 * Change    : BD22JAN04
 * Why       : Use the label for the title for buttons with an image
 * 
 * Change    : DGS02FEB2004
 * Why       : In getEntityCollection, now resolve attr group directors using a new
 *             function of the entity. This preserves 'original' values so that the
 *             resolve can be repeated using the same entity.
 *            : Also made sure all querynames are resolved.
 * 
 * Change    : DGS12FEB2004
 * Why       : Minor changes to support the 'Matrix' edit form. Also new function
 *             'handleEnhancers' to eliminate duplicate code in edit form, grid edit form
 *             and new matrix edit form.
 * 
 * Change    : BD14FEB04
 * Why       : - Added support for alert message
 *             - Pass -zXInStdPopupTab around when o all pageflows in stdPopup tab
 * 
 * Change    : BD16FEB04
 * Why       : In relevantEntity, a gridForm entity is relevant when either
 *             the selectEditGroup or selectList group is set
 * 
 * Change    : BD23FEB04
 * Why       : Allow strAttr to be nullstring in processAttributeValues; this
 *             is interpreted as not wanting to set any attrs
 * 
 * Change    : BD27FEB04
 * Why       : When generating popup menus, use the action name as well to
 *             make the name unique; this allows for combining different
 *             actions with popup menus on a single page
 * 
 * Change    : DGS02MAR2004
 * Why       : In constructURL, treat an empty URL the same as #dummy i.e. no URL
 * 
 * Change    : BD5MAR04
 * Why       : Complex hack: see comment marked with BD5MAR04 
 * 
 * Change    : BD30MAR04
 * Why       : Fixed bug: forgot to reset alertMsg after processing
 * 
 * Change    : DGS21APR2004
 * Why       : Retrieve SQL: Added Group By clause to queries.
 *             Also: stop generating empty javascript tags (in a couple of places).
 * 
 * Change    : BD6MAY04
 * Why       : Change context to use main context rather than sub-context
 * 
 * Change    : DGS11MAY2004
 * Why       : Uses existing 'actions' refs (previously not used) to generate follow-on
 *             actions.
 *             New frame type of 'simple ref'
 * 
 * Change    : BD22MAY04
 * Why       : Added the very special director '#js.'; this is not really
 *             a director as it is not resolved using the director handler;
 *             it is ONLY supported as a source of a querystring
 *             and allow you to include javascript inside standard pageflow URLs
 *             This can be very useful to include values of fields on the
 *             current form in URLs without having to submit and processthe
 *             form first.
 *             E.g.
 *             URL - doSomething
 *             Frame - window
 *             Type - action
 *             Query string entries
 *                #js.#fieldValue.clnt.nme    -nme
 * 
 *             This will pass the current value of the field clnt.nme
 *             in the querystring as 'name'
 * 
 * Change    : BD26MAY04
 * Why       : Added sizedWindow framenumber; bit of a special case, see
 *             comments in wrapRefUrl
 * 
 * Change    : BD4JUN04
 * Why       : Fixed serious thing in processAtrValues: now also support zxDates (ie
 *             in ddmmmyy / ddmmyyyy) format
 * 
 * Change    : BD14JUN04
 * Why       : Added forceFocusAttr; see editForm for use
 * 
 * Change    : BD4UL04
 * Why       : - Fixed bug with -wrn qs entry (used for warnings in edit form); do NOT
 *               include in qs as result of propagate qs
 *             - Fixed bug in resolveLink when using external pageflow action
 * 
 * Change    : BD12JUL04
 * Why       : Fixed bug in handling actions; active was not implements
 * 
 * Change    : 03AUG2004 Domarque Workshop 59
 * Why       : In exportList, was generating an empty column when 'null' group.
 * 
 * Change    : BD8AUG04
 * Why       : Fixed bug in processAttributeValues: was not able to set
 *             a non-string value to null using reserved #null source (ie value|
 * 
 * Change    : BD11AUG04
 * Why       : Support confirmation on submit-ref buttons
 * 
 * Change    : BD10SEP04
 * Why       : Changed way that debugging is done to ensure that generated
 *             debug messages do not screw up the generated HTML / Javascript
 * Why       : Added basic server-side page timing when in debug mode
 *  
 * Change    : DGSOCT2004
 * Why       : Added Calendar action type
 * 
 * Change    : DGS5NOV2004
 * Why       : In processHTMLTags, some tag names were not lower case when compared to lcase
 *  
 * Change    : BD06DEC04
 * Why       : Undid a terrible hack introduced at 22MAY04 (not even added to
 *             this comment area but is commented in code)
 *                 
 * Change    : V1.4:14 - BD11JAN05
 * Why       : - Undoing the 22MAY04 bug (see 6DEC04) invalidated
 *               a feature that only worked because of the bug of 22MAY04
 *             - Also minor performance thing in resolveDirector
 *                
 * Change    : V1.4:19 - BD17JAN05
 * Why       : - Use seperate instance of HTML object for the pageflow
 *               used in external pageflow actions; sharing the HTML object
 *               caused some funny side-effects
 *                
 * Change    : V1.4:25 - DGS21JAN2005
 * Why       : In wrapRefUrl, added new frame type of 'submitcheck', which behaves just like
 *             'submit' except that, if there is a confirm message' the javascript will call
 *             'zXSubmitThisUrlCheck' rather than zXSubmitThisUrlConfirm'.
 *
 * Change    : V1.4:27 - BD24JAN05
 * Why       : In processAttributeValues, a bug caused all attributes to be
 *             set to null as soon as one #null was found
 *
 * Change    : V1.4:32 - BD6FEB05
 * Why       : Added support for image in search form order by label (is now HTML tag)
 * 
 * Change    : V1.4:33 - BD6FEB05
 * Why       : On export list, make progress go all the way to 100%; otherwise looks
 *             silly when user has configured machine so that XLS / CSV opens in
 *             a separate window; it leaves the export window open and this used to
 *             go only as far a 90%
 * 
 * Change    : V1.4:39 - BD/DGS11FEB2005
 * Why       : In constructURL, must restore the -pf QS entry as it may have been altered.
 *             In processTags, minor adjustment to the recent zxsearchformorderbyimage tag name.
 *             In getEntityCollection, was looping through all entities in two places where
 *             should only loop through returned entities.
 * 
 * Change    : V1.4:44 - DGS18FEB2005
 * Why       : In processFrameHandling changed the 'bigger' percentages from 80/20 to 70/30
 * 
 * Change    : V1.4:58 - DGS/MB22MAR2005
 * Why       : In processRefByFormType now disables submitted buttons on click. Also change
 *             here and in wrapRefUrl to the calls of the javascript function zXSubmitThisUrl
 *             (and similar variants) to pass 'this', as the js will disable the button.
 *             This is all designed to prevent multiple submits.
 * 
 * Change    : V1.5:1 - BD30MAR05
 * Why       : Added support for data sources
 *
 * Change    : V1.5:3 - BD15APR05
 * Why       : Added support for page-flow action BO context
 * 
 * Change    : BD18MAY05 - V1.5:18
 * Why       : Added support for property persistStatus
 * 
 * Change    : V1.4:90 - DGS16JUN2005
 * Why       : In exportList now has slightly adjusted logic for showing the progress bar
 * 			   to fix a problem found when exporting large numbers of rows
 * 
 * Change    : BD18MAY05 - V1.5:32
 * Why       : Added support for createUpdateActions
 * 
 * Change    : BD3OCT05  V1.5:61
 * Why       : Added support for confirmation message for stdPopup action
 * 
 * Change    : BD18OCT05  V1.5:65
 * Why       : Added support for parameterBags and pageflow calls
 *
 * Change    : V1.5:95 DGS/BD28APR2006
 * Why       : - New feature to be able to make ref buttons appear at the top of forms and
 *               behave like a menu bar
 *             - processCUActions can ignore warnings
 *
 * Change    : V1.5:101 / BD15JUN06
 * Why       : Fixed bug when having a linke action with an external pageflow in combination
 *
 * Change    : V1.5:102 / BD27JUN06
 * Why       : Export to csv when there is a group with selectListGroup <> null and listGroup null.
 *               This can cause problems in a scenario as the following: imagine you have 3 entities;
 *               2 selectListGroup something and listGroup null and one with a group that has several
 *               attributes with dynamic values. These dynamic values can rely on the selectListGroup
 *               attributes to be loaded for the other entitieswith popup menu on the action that the
 *               link action is from. See processPopups
