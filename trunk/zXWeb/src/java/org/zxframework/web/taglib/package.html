<h3>ZX taglib.</h3>

<p>This is a convience library of JSP developers wanting to create custom JSP pages.</p>

<p>Here is some example JSP custom tags that could be used. One for initialising 
the zX object and another to do the logging. These JSP custom tags are more of a 
proof of concept than some thing worthwhile using. </p>

<p>
However the idea is to extend these and allow for the creation of table tags and form tags etc..
</p>

<p>
<b>TODO :</b><br/>

<ul>
 <li>Need to implement the Footter funcions as tags. Like the quick bar.</li>
 <li>Need to code in the standpard page builder components like form title/button area etc.</li>
</ul>
