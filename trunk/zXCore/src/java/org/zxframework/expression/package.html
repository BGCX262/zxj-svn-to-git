<body>
<p>Expressions is a rich scripting language to allow developers to quick get value that are live in the framework.</p>

<p>
zX has a built-in macro language referred to as the expression language. 
The expression language was originally designed as a simple way to provide the flexibility of 
dynamic value in strategic places. Over time, the expression language has evolved to a 
fully functional macro language that can be extended relatively easily.
</p>

<p>
The syntax of the expression language is based on functional languages (like LISP) where everything is a 
function call with parameters. For example: 1 + 2 would be expressed as add(1, 2).  
There were two good reasons to implement the expressions as a functional language:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A functional syntax is easier and quicker to parse than procedural languages
</li>
<li>
A functional language was the better option given the original low-ambitions of expressions
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, given the importance of expressions in many zX applications, it is often suggested 
that the functional syntax is cumbersome and difficult to maintain. Point taken….
</p>

<p>
At the heart of the expressions is the object <i>ExpressionHandler</i>. zX is used as the factory for this object. 
The expression handler is the only object that developers need to work with expressions.
</p>

<p>
Expressions can be evaluated in two ways: by executing expressions that have been parsed and stored or 
by evaluating a string that represents an expression.  The set / execute method is only used by advanced 
applications that use expressions as an integral part of the functionality (for example rule engines). 
All expressions are stored in the expression cache, even when they are executed using the evaluate method. 
Each expression that is successfully parsed is stored as an instance of <i>Expression</i>.
</p>


<p>There are three main things you can do with an expression:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Evaluate.</i> Evaluate the expression and return its value
</li>
<li>
<i>Describe.</i> Describe the expression in English (this is useful for maintenance of expressions)
</li>
<li>
<i>API.</i> Give the API of a single expression function (this is used by the repository editor to provide 
			support for expression editing)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Control Statements</h3>

<p>Once we were making more use of expressions we found an important shortcoming of the way expressions 
were evaluated. When evaluating an expression, the system always evaluates all parameters for a function 
and than passes this as a collection of arguments to the handler that implements the function (see next paragraph).
<br/>
Imagine the following functionality:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<pre>
<code>
 if (i != 0) {
 	function = 8 / i;
 } else {
 	function = -1;
 }
</code>
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Implemented in the expression language as follows:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<pre>
<code>
if(ne(i,0),div(8,[i]),-1)
</code>
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The ‘if’ function takes 3 parameter: the condition, the ‘true value’ and the ‘false value’. 
However, as described earlier, the system will evaluate all parameters and pass them as a 
collection to the if-function handler. This can thus result in a divide-by-zero situation.
</p>

<p>
In order to cater for such (and many other) scenarios, we have introduce control statement 
in version 1.4 of zX. There are a number of control statements, ‘if’ being one of them 
and each control statement has a functional counterpart (for backward compatibility). 
Each control statement function name starts with an underscore (e.g. ‘_id’ and ‘_and’). 
Although it is legal to start a function name with an underscore, it is for this reason that you shouldn’t.
</p>

<p>
When the system evaluates control statements, it will first evaluate the parameter that defines what parameters 
are relevant. All non-relevant parameters are simply ignored. 
</p>

<h3>Function Handlers</h3>

<p>
All functions supported by the expression handler are implemented in function handlers. 
The zX core comes with 2 handlers: the default handler and the business object handler 
(ExprFHBO and <i>ExprFHDefault</i>). All handlers must implement the <i>ExprFH</i> interface. 
This is all described in great detail in the document on ‘Extending the Framework’.
</p>

<p>
Any number of function handlers can be ‘registered’ by simply adding the class name 
and logical name to the application configuration file.  If the logical name is ‘myLib’ than all 
functions prefixed with ‘myLib.’ are assumed to be handled by that handler.
</p>

<h3>User Defined Functions</h3>

<p>
Functions that are prefixed with ‘usr.’ are user defined functions (you would be excused
to think that there would be a function handler that was registered with the logical name ‘usr’).
</p>

<p>
You can store expression functions in the table <i>zXUsrFnctnDfntn</i>. Each expression in this table is 
stored with a name and number of parameters.  You can now refer to this expression definition in the 
table as <i>usr.functionName</i>. In the function definition you refer to the parameters as <i>usrP1</i>, 
<i>usrP2</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>
User defined functions can be useful to create ‘short cuts’ for standard expressions. 
Note that developing a bespoke function  handler should be considered where speed, 
control and exception handling are essential.
</p>

<h3>Iterators</h3>

<p>
Iterators are a mechanism for expressions to loop over items. The <i>_loopOver</i> 
control statement (the only control statement that does not have a functional counterpart) 
can be used to loop over the items in an iterator and execute an expression for all iterations.
</p>

<p>
It is beyond the scope of this document to explain the workings of iterators. 
Sufficient to say that iterators are implemented as objects that implement the <i>ExprFHI</i> abstract class.
 Two iterator implementations are provided as part of zX core: <i>ExprFHIDefault</i> and <i>ExprFHIRS</i>, 
the first for a collection of values the second for result sets.
