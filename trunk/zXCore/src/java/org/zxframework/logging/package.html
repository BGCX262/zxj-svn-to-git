<p>Logging API.</p>

<p>
This is an adopted version of the apache commons logging api, which is a 
wrapper to other logging apis. Like Log4j (the most flexible and high 
performant api) and the JDK1.4 logging api. There is also a SimpleLog, that
just logs to System.err. We can make a version like this that logs to a file.
</p>

<p>
With Log4j we can easily expand on the logging functionality and also include
other open source api which use the same logging apis
