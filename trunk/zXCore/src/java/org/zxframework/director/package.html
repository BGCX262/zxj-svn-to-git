<title>Overview Documentation for zX Directors</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
Director is a simple scripting language to allow developers to quick get value that are live in the framework.
</p>

<p>
Directors are the predecessor of expressions and are a very simple (and thus quick and cheap) 
way of providing dynamic values where required.  The history of directors and expressions have 
brought some confusion to the Framework for which our apologies. 
</p>

<p>
Where applicable, you can enter either a literal value or a director. A ‘#’ as the first character indicates 
that the value is to be interpreted as a director. Otherwise, the value is taken as a literal.
</p>

<p>
Directors (and expressions) are mainly applicable to Web development but are part of the core of zX. 
In descriptors only the default value can be entered as a director (and, to add to the confusion, 
not even in its most standard way!).
</p>

<p>
The archetype of the directors is <i>#qs.-pk</i>, indicating that there is an entry in the quick-context 
with the name ‘–pk’ whose value is to be used. Readers with even the smallest exposure to page-flow 
development will recognize this.
</p>

<p>
Other director examples are: <i>#date</i> (today’s date) and <i>#user</i> (user-id of current user).
</p>

<p>
Another director is the <i>#expr</i> director. This can be used to evaluate an expression in a situation where 
a director is allowed. For example: <i>#expr.add(1, 8)</i>.
</p>

<p>
Directors are supported by the class <i>DrctrHndlr</i>. Although zX can act as a factory for an instance of this 
object, it is not likely that you will use this directly. Instead, you should use the <i>resolveDirector</i> method 
of zX.
</p>

<p>
Directors are always treated as strings and this is an essential difference with expressions whose result is 
treated as a property object (unless invoked using the #expr director of-course when the result is converted 
to a string). 
</p>

<h3>Director Handlers</h3>

Director functions are implemented much like expression handlers although it is very unlikely that 
anybody would ever bother to add a director function handler (in fact: I would personally discourage them!).  
For completeness: the interface director handlers must implement is <i>DrcrtFH</i> and <i>DrcrtFHDefault</i> is 
an implementation that is part of the zX core.<br/>

<b>Important note:</b> director functions are not prefixed with the logical name of the handler.

<h3>The Big Director Confusion</h3>

<p>Back to the confusion about directors and time for some history.</p>

<p>
Directors where part of zX almost from day 1, long before expressions. Directors where introduced 
especially for page-flow development (the <i>#qs.-pk</i> example!). 
Soon, we realised that sometimes a simple director was not enough and that we sometimes needed a piece 
of text where some elements where replaced at run-time, i.e. directors contained in a string. This was 
mainly triggered by URLs and labels in page-flows.
</p>

<p>
The problem with simple directors was that the ‘#’ was a perfect token to recognize the start of a 
director but there was no way to tell that the director was done and the containing text was to be 
taken literally again. Thus we introduced <b>in-string</b> directors. A special type of directors supported 
in only a few places in page-flows.  
</p>

<p>
An in-string-director is a text that may contain directors enclosed in a pair of ‘#’. Examples are:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
<code>

 Search #entitylabel#
 zXCloseSubSession('#qs.-s#', '#qs.-ss#')</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Later we introduced expressions and you could use the concat function to achieve the same.
</p>

<p>
When we were really up to speed with expressions we realised that there are occasions 
were the good old in-string director was much more convenient that a complex expression 
with lots of parameters to the concat function.  A typical scenario is a template for a text 
that you want to use for data-merge purposes. <br/>
Because a text tends to have some form of layout, the concat function is too cumbersome. 
However, the in-string-director is too limited for a number of reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It never supported an escape character so you could not use a ‘#’ in a director; 
this was particularly inconvenient if you wanted to make complex directors using the #expr option
</li>
<li>
You could not nest directors 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So we introduced the ultimate in-string-director. This can be used wherever you can use in-string-directors. 
Instead of using a pair of ‘#’, we now use a pair of ‘>’. The difference may seem subtle but it did 
allow us to write a director handler than can deal with very complex merge-texts.
</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use simple directors where possible</li>
<li>Use #expr option and an expression for more complex cases where layout of the result is not relevant</li>
<li>Use traditional in-string-director in label, URL and Javascript tag in pagef-flows</li>
<li>Use complex in-string-directors in other scenarios</li>
</ul>
