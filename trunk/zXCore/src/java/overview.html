The java port relies heavily on the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Apache commons libraries</a>.
Some of the libraries are used only in one or two places and may be replaced by a local implementation. 
Here are the common libraries used :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/">BeanUtils</a> -  Commons-BeanUtils provides easy-to-use wrappers around the Java reflection and 
		introspection APIs. 
		<i>This is only used in a couple of places when use edit messagers. 
		This is being used indirectly by the Digestor library.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/codec/">Codec</a> - Codec contains some general encoding/decoding algorithms. 
		Includes some phonetic encoders, Hex, Base64, and a URL encoder. 
		<i>This is being used by the soundex function in the StringUtils class.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/">Collections</a> - Commons-Collections provides a suite of classes that extend or 
		augment the Java Collections Framework. 
		<i>This is used indirectly by other Apache Commons libraries.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester/">Digester</a>s - Commons-Digester is an XML-to-Java-object mapping utility commonly used 
		for parsing XML configuration files. 
		<i>This is used for parsing the xml configuration files. However this was
		only started to be used on QueryDef onwards, the older code still needed to be refactored.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/">Lang</a> - Commons-Lang provides a very common set of utility classes that provide extra 
		functionality for classes in java.lang. 
		<i>This is used as it supplies a work for mimicing Enums in JDK 1.4. 
		NOTE : This is now a feature of Java 5.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">Logging</a> -  Commons-Logging is a wrapper around a variety of logging API implementations.
		<i>The logging in the framework is based on the Apache Commons Logging, but it is more tightly intergrated
		into the framework. We may switch back to this later on. This is used indirectly by other Apache Commons libraries.</i>
	</li>
</ul>

Other libraries used by the framework :

<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/">Ehcache</a> -  Ehcache is a pure Java, in-process cache. <i>This is used
	in various places to cache descriptors and other objects.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="http://jazzy.sourceforge.net/">Jazzy</a> - Jazzy is a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 
	that allow you to add spell checking functionality to Java Applications. <i>This is optionally used by the special
	spellchecker component. I would advice using Openoffice Spellchecker instead.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy </a> - Groovy is an agile dynamic language for the Java 2 Platform 
	that has many of the features that people like so much in languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk, making them 
	available to Java developers using a Java-like syntax. <i>This is a optional component used to all users to script
	expressions using groovy.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaqa/2003-01/01-qa-0110-timing_p.html">Hrtlib</a> - Simple timing library. 
	<i>Used in development mode to time the execution of pages more accurately.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a> - JDOM is a simple to use API for XML parsing.
	<i>Used in the old Descriptor parsing and zX Config parsing. Need to port this to Digester.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Openoffice SDK</a> - The OpenOffice.org SDK is an add-on for the OpenOffice.org 
	office suite. It provides the necessary tools and documentation for programming the OpenOffice.org APIs and 
	creating own extensions (UNO components) for OpenOffice.org. <i>Using this for the spellchecker component which
	is now complete. And for the port of the docbuilder component.</i>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="http://jaxen.org/">Jaxen</a> -  The jaxen project is a Java XPath Engine. jaxen is a universal 
	object model walker, capable of evaluating XPath expressions across multiple models. Currently supported are dom4j, JDOM, and DOM.
	<i>Currently this is only used in zX.configValue, when you want to retrieve values from  a dom object.</i>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will try and streamline the number of required dependencies to the bare minimum.

<h3>Potential bottlenecks and solutions:</h3>

<p>
At the moment there is no performance problems, but as of yet the Java port has not been probably benchmarked and
there is still alot of functionality that needs to implemented which may effect the performance. Here is a list of potentional
problems and solutions. NOTE : Java is NOT as lightweight as VB, but it does offer some extra benifits.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<i>Database latency : </i> This is always the biggest bottleneck in an application, one way of improving 
	performance is by reducing the data transferred bettween the application and the database. 
	The <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/lazyLoad.html">Lazy Load</a> will only get the data as
	the user needs it, here is an <a href="http://www.anands.net/articles/lazyLoad.html">example implementation</a>
	this used the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/reflection/proxy.html">Dynamic Proxy Class</a> 
	available in JDK 1.3 and up. 
	<br/><br/>
	
	Another way is by caching frequently used data that is not updated often. We could specify the caching in the 
	framework business object and then use <a href="http://jcache.sourceforge.net/">JCache</a>  
	or <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/jcs/">JCS</a> to manage the cache. We could also use Websphere
	build in caching. This can increase performance up to 10 times the speed.
	<br/><br/>
	
	With some light intergration with Hibernate we could use its highly optimized sql and db engine to improve performance.
	This is required anyway if we are to use implemented AS400 tables in Hibernate in CPA Direct or any other non-framework
	java application.
	<br/><br/>
	</li>

	<li>
	<i>zx initialization overhead : </i> Each time a page is loaded zx goes under full initialization, this includes reading configuration
	files and get data from the datbase. This is great for development as we can change settings and it is updated immediately.
	However on a live system you do not need that flexibility. We could cache the database stuff and only reinitialization the
	configuration settings if the file has been updated. We can store the cached settings in the HttpSession object and allow
	Websphere to manage the security of access data from the session. NOTE : This is not cached.
	<br/><br/>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<i>XML parsing : </i>	At the moment there is only a very small overhead, but as the framework uses xml quite
	heavily this could add up. We could use the Apache Commons Digester to read the XML configuration files, this should
	double the performance and also make it easier to parse the xml config files. However the core zx config file parsing
	may need to remain the same as it allows users to get values in a just-in-time way via the configVale method. There is 
	also some areas in the Descriptor that uses just in time parsing. NOTE : Business objects and Pageflow xml parsing is cachable.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Conventions</h3>
<p>
I have tried to stick as close as possible to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">standard java code conventions</a>.
